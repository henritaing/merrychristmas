    "A few days ago, the two girls had returned to London after celebrating New Year's Eve at a common friend's house, for the start of the semester, and had found themselves mired in a deep pit of unmotivation."
    "Arthur would return home in a week so Jeanne insisted that Elise stayed home although the heating of her building had already been repaired." 
    "Elise could only agree. But, since she didn't do much, apart from going to work, class, and overthinking about her nonexistent love life, she was slowly getting depressed."
    "On the other hand, Jeanne was a slacker and a homebody by nature so she enjoyed going back to her life as a stay-at-home university student."

    j "You're getting depressing, you know. Let's get snacks. You'll see that life isn't that bad."
    e "Should I text him?"
    j "Black hole-dense. For him, anything's a friendly gesture. I know it sounds contradictory. But he's the problem. He's a walking contradiction." 

    "Jeanne glanced at Elise."

    j "White doesn't look bad on you."
    e "It was pretty cheap, and the quality is amazing considering it's third-hand. It replaces my old torn jacket perfectly, don't you think?"
    j "As long as it keeps you warm."

    "Outside was as demoralizing as winter could get. No lights could illuminate these gloomy streets. Nobody smiled. Their eyes were glued to the ground like diamonds would emerge and free them from the capitalistic society."

    "On the way to the supermarket, Elise couldn't help but ask."

    e "Even if he's dense, how about a hug? Like a light hug?"

    "Jeanne stopped in her tracks. Her face was a mix of astonishment and disgust."

    j "What did you do to my brother?"
    e "He gave me a gift for Christmas."
    j "Yeah, the dog coat. I remember."
    e "Then, he hugged me."

    "Jeanne wheezed as her eyes sparkled."

    j "Did he? Bah. He hugs his friends too. Don't scare me like that."
    e "I should have kissed him."
    j "Wow. Wait. What if he had a girlfriend?"

    "Elise blankly stared at Jeanne."

    e "Does he have one?"
    j "How come you never asked him about it?"
    e "I don't know. I thought that maybe, you'd tell me if that was the case."

    "Elise woke up early to open the café. While she poured the boiling water into her green mug, she heard a door creaking."
    "Pink pajamas with winged pigs on it, disheveled black hair, yawning like a lion, Jeanne trudged to one of the kitchen chairs."

    "Elise consulted the time on the clock, then on her phone. It was indeed seven in the morning. Jeanne put her head in their arms without a word and soon began to snore."

    "The negotiations went straight on full steam."

    "Meanwhile, Elise drank her black tea, and brushed her teeth. She was delighted to see Arthur again."

    e "No."
    j "Eh?"

    "Jeanne's jaw hit the floor."

    e "I'm kidding, you're in luck. The boss's son's here today."

    e "If I knew it was that easy to convince you to join the café."

    e "That's one thing I admire about you."

    "Contrary to his expectations based on what Elise shared about her, Jeanne proved to be quite competent with customers. During rush hours, she displayed remarkable composure and during the quieter times, she contributed to the joyful atmosphere of the café. "

    j "How would you know?"
    e "Because he didn't show anything on his face and didn't mention it later. He just nodded."
    j "Right. Hard to tell what he thinks."
    e "Yes. But I do agree. He looked sad. Maybe, there's something I might have forgotten."

    "Elise glanced at Arthur's bedroom. In total, she had lived there for three weeks."
    "She had gotten used to smiling at the rows of romance novels sorted by their authors' name on the bookshelves; she had gotten used to seeing the folded men's shirt and pants in the wardrobe; and she had gotten used to sleeping in this single bed with a single pillow and a single duvet." 
    "She put the sheets in the laundry machine and waved goodbye to Jeanne who lazily waved her hand without detaching her eyes from the TV."

    "Elise asked Arthur about his holidays."
    "He thought long before speaking like he was recalling every detail and choosing the ones that would interest her. While his voice was full of energy, the strained traits of his face said otherwise."
    "He began by his family visit in Munich which was cut short, because he had to help with the cottage renovations."
    "As cliche as it sounded, over there, he had eaten kilograms and kilograms of sausages and potatoes, and speed-hiked a lot in the forests nearby. It had been arduous. Amidst that, they had a swim in the lake."

    j "Wasn't it frozen?"
    a "It was, but we dove head first, haha. You've got to try someday. I think that was the part I loved the most."

    "Afterwards, in Paris, he went to the football field where he started football and enjoyed a game with strangers. In the evening, he met with his highschool group of friends at a fairly affordable traditional French restaurant."
    "It had been hell to organize it as they all had their own personal lives and preoccupations, but the stories they shared made the trouble worthwhile. Two years without seeing each other was a lot. Some were planning to marry while others had discovered what they wished to do in their lives."

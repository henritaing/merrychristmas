    "The atmosphere at the café didn't change. It had shifted. Sebastian looked better. He even became more expressive. Her grandmother's condition had improved. On the other side, Elise sighed at every opportunity."

    "Jeanne invited her home to discuss what bothered her. She made her sit in front of her at the kitchen table."
    "Next, she brought her bedside lamp and directed towards Elise who frowned, before switching on the living room lights and switching off the kitchen ones to create the desired and peculiar ambiance."

    j "First question. Is it related to Arthur?"
    e "Aren't you having too much fun?"

    "Elise glanced at Jeanne's detective cap and sunglasses."

    j "Answer, Miss Pellicer. Is it related to my brother?"
    e "No, it's not."

    "A shade of red colored her ears."

    j "Miss Pellicer. Why don't you just tell me the truth?"
    e "I'm telling the truth."

    "An extra shade cropped up."
    "Jeanne set up an imaginary mirror."

    j "Look for yourself. You can lie, but your body can't. Not for now at least." 
    e "I'd feel about if I don't talk now after you made all that effort."

    "Jeanne turned to the left and did an ok-sign with her fingers."

    j "I told you. I'm the best."
    e "What are you doing?"
    j "Telling my imaginary crew that our main culprit is ready to give her sources."

    "Elise almost laughed, before turning serious."

    e "Do you know a brunette that takes the bus to university?"
    j "Did you just describe three quarters of the school?"
    e "She's one of Arthur's friends, I assume, from the way they talked to each other. She's about five feet five. Long black hair tied into a ponytail. Her shoulders were large for a woman and she also had curves that fitted her body."
    j "That's a precise description. Five feet five?"

    "Jeanne converted the feet into centimeters on her phone."

    j "Oh, 1m65. Ok. You didn't follow them, did you?"
    e "Never. Only a stalker would do that. I went past them when I was going to class."
    j "I'll ask my brother about it."
    e "I feel like I'm prying into his personal life. I'd rather ask myself."
    j "Even though your interest would be made obvious?"

    "Elise nodded and gulped down the tea."

    e "It made me feel better to talk about it. Do you have other questions for me, officer?"
    j "The others are for Arthur."

    "Arthur cooked dinner and watched an anime Jeanne chose while eating. Strangely enough, Jeanne dozed off during the show. She looked like she didn't enjoy it as much as before."
    "He took a sip of water when Jeanne suddenly pulled a brown cap and sunglasses from nowhere. A blinding light shone on his face as the lights of the living room were turned off."

    a "You really ought to learn how to be tactful."
    j "I might have skipped that lesson when I skipped a year."
    a "How come I didn't? Anyway, I don't have anyone. Didn't Elise tell you? She asked me the same question earlier by text."
    j "Oh, did she? Interesting."
    a "Don't get any ideas."
    j "So who's that girl who's around one meter sixty-five, brunette, with nice curves? Someone to whom you gave something today?"
    a "Are you stalking me?"
    j "Nope. As a matter of fact, I didn't go out today except for going to the café. Like yesterday and the day before."
    a "Where's that café?"
    j "Next to the church."
    a "Oh. It should be the one near where I usually go. I'll come by."
    j "No, thank you. So, who is she?"

    "Elise put her phone back in her trousers and went out of the staff room. Her five-minute break was over."
    "He was not in a relationship."
    "She sighed in relief. She could work in an approximate peace of mind."
    "The restaurant was bustling like every night since last summer when an actor celebrity was sighted eating there. The fifteen tables inside were full, and the terrace too. Even then, there was a long queue outside waiting to taste the famous pizza that could even make celebrities break their diets."
    "The din was making her feel a bit faint tonight. Kids were stamping on the table with their cutlery; groups of friends were bursting in laughter; and a couple was arguing over the choice of the film they'll watch tonight."

    "A colleague bumped into her and profusely apologized. Fortunately, he managed to not drop anything."

    "She trotted her way to the table and took our her tablet."

    e "Hi, may I take your orders?"

    "Elise asked with the biggest smile she could muster."

    "She wrote down their orders and asked them if they wanted anything else to which they said no."
    "She retrieved the menu cards, and lifted her head up from the glowing screen, before squinting."

    "Arthur grinned with his teeth fully showing. He had combed his mid-long dark hair and was wearing a red tie with a white shirt, looking handsome and neat. In front of him, a man in his thirties in a black suit she didn't know was frowning, and asked if the terms of the contract were that bad."
    "Arthur said this wasn't that, before talking to her."

    a "I didn't know you worked there. How's your shift going?"

    "Elise thought of the texts they had just exchanged and blushed. She had been way too conspicuous."

    e "It's going well. Lots of people today."

    "Teasing Elise was one of Jeanne's favorite things to do, but now that her friend's feelings deepened, she didn't feel like doing it anymore. Jeanne simply watched as Elise took baby steps towards Arthur. Elise even refused her help, “It'd feel too forceful and fake”."
    "So Jeanne carried on her leisurely daily life."

    "One day, she heard a feminine voice she didn't recognize in the kitchen. She had two alternatives. Investigate or stay holed up in her room. By now, you'd have guessed what she chose. She put on her headphones and resumed her anime."
    "But then, someone knocked on her door. She ignored it, and she shouldn't have. Arthur slammed the door open and threw her pillow right on her face."

    j "Fuck you!"

    "She went out of her comfortable room. Her mind was awake and ready. One last step and she'd have vision on the enemy territory."

    scene bg Livingroom_Night

    "To surprise the enemy and to avoid any bullet coming her way, she rolled over and lifted her head up, prepared to fire at any threat, only to see a beautiful brunette with a cup of coffee in her hand. It was Carolina."

    a "She skipped a year, so her mental age has a bit to catch up."

    "Arthur said, his eyes devoid of any emotion, while the woman at his side was laughing out loud."

    j "Like you."

    "It was the woman Elise had told her about. Jeanne was sure of it. The brunette wiped her tears of laughter away and invited Jeanne to sit."

    c "I've brought a chocolate cake from my parents' bakery. It's a rare opportunity. They often sell out. Your plate's the one who has been untouched."

    "Jeanne put down the pillow and seated herself, before thanking her for the cake in the most natural way possible by bowing her head."

    "She took a spoon from her plate."

    j "Not bad. It's definitely one of the best Black Forest cakes I've eaten. So how do you do, Carolina?"
    c "Same as usual. Business and management."

    "Jeanne nodded seriously, pretending to be interested."

    j "So, how do you like it so far?"
    e "I'd rather have a coffee and a piece of cake at home."
    j "Home?"
    e "I've got my own place now. I was lucky and found one affordable flat in the southern suburbs. Living with other people is nice and all, but that's work in itself."
    j "I totally feel you."
    a "You've got the wrong idea, Jeanne. You don't like interacting with people, because you're lazy whereas she doesn't like interacting with people, because she feels superior to them and it'd be a waste of her time and energy."
    c "Why do you have to word it like that?"
    j "Yeah, why are you saying it in such a pejorative manner?"
    a "Why are you banding together against me?"

    "Carolina turned to Jeanne."

    c "Your brother told me that you've chosen the Bachelor of Physics. Do you know which master program you'll apply to?"

    "Jeanne filtered her inner monologue which went like this: first of all, this is not something you ask bachelor students when they just started. Not only you'll cause them a great amount of stress, but also you'll put them in a situation where they have to think about their future and nobody wants to do that." 
    "Secondly, since I arrived in London four months ago, I've been attempting my best to adjust my life to this new city and country. Then, I got my part-time job." "Thirdly, I only applied for a Bachelor of Physics in the UK, because I was good in Physics and, to be honest, because I wanted to get away from my parents' expectations and French preparatory classes. So, I'm not even set on studying for a master's degree, but I guess I'll still do it to get a 'proper diploma' and a proper 'job' in the eyes of my parents."

    j "I haven't really pondered on it."
    a "Don't stress about it. You still lots of time."
    c "There's the option to take a gap year too."
    a "We can take a look at the master's degrees given by the university. It's not like we had anything else to do."

    "Arthur looked at Carolina."

    a "We got nothing, right?"
    c "Don't stare at me like that. You're the one who's always busy. And, I mean, it'd be interesting to see what kind of master our university offers."
    j "Are you sure? I thought you had a bunch of things to do, Arthur."
    a "And it's going to get worse. So, today's the best day. I can spare an hour or two for you."

    "The random snack time transformed into an orientation session. Overwhelmed by the kindness and the amount of information, Jeanne felt more lost than ever, but she had faith that it'd work out eventually. Until then, she crawled to her bed as Arthur drove Carolina home."

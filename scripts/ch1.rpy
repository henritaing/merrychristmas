    "The night breath began to feel cold on Jeanne's naked legs."
    "It's a dream." 
    "Sitting on the street adjacent to the club, her elbows on her knees, she gazed at the moon, and thought about the live show of her favorite idol she missed."
    "“The first party of the year's the best for socializing as no group was formed yet”, Arthur had said. Yet, people arrived in cliques, all drunkenly laughing, appearing to know each other from highschool and clubs and such. "
    "Well, it was only the first week, she still had time to make friends. She only needed one or two. If necessary, she'd take the initiative."

    "A blonde woman with a dark blue dress sat beside her."

    "Blonde" "Hey, are you going home too?"

    j "Yeah, waiting for the bus."

    "Jeanne squinted. This face. She would have remembered it if they had met before. It was the typical unapproachable girl guys would confess to before summer break just to get over their feelings."

    e "I'm Elise. First year in Bachelor of Physics."
    j "Jeanne. Same as you."
    e "What courses have you chosen? I've never met you at school."

    "Jeanne scratched her head before clicking her tongue. Arthur's reflex whenever he was troubled had contaminated her."

    e "Sorry, maybe you wanted some quiet." 

    "Jeanne waved her hand as to dissipate the misunderstanding."

    j "So, about school. Yeah, I don't go to lectures."

    "A frown appeared on Elise's face, but Jeanne didn't catch it."

    e "But it hasn't even been two weeks. Did your parents force you to follow this Bachelor's degree?"
    j "No, no, I did. To chill."
    e "To chill?"
    j "To watch anime, K-dramas, Netflix shows. Read manga, webtoon. Play video games, sleep in, etc. You?"

    "Elise looked in the distance, a dreamy smile hung on her lips."

    e "I can't really 'chill'."

    "It was a beautiful smile, with complex undertones."

    j "That's sad."

    e "Is it? Don't you get bored sometimes from 'chilling'?"

    j "Can't deny it."

    "The moonlight stretched over the top of the church down the street, letting Jeanne see that it was already three in the morning."

    e "Isn't there something you would like to do? I don't know, a stupid goal?"

    j "I'd love to have something like that."

    "A round silence filled the space between the two of them before Jeanne decided to pop it."

    "Elise chuckled once again."

    "Months passed by in a blink of an eye and winter settled in London in a grey snow."
    "Christmas being around the corner, Jeanne would soon leave her warm blanket to visit her parents back in France. Of course, she was ecstatic at the idea of visiting them. But, she knew that the topic of studies would come out and she didn't want to talk about it."
    "Additionally, Elise's building heating conveniently broke yesterday, so she was looking for a place to stay and Jeanne was looking for a reason to stay. What kind of friend would she be if she left Elise to be freezing in her small studio?"

    j "I met her four months ago. Anyway, she'll be there in a minute, I'll see you in a week."
    a "Say hello to her. She can use my bedroom, I've washed the sheets and all."
    j "Yes, sir."
    a "Make sure to thank her properly. She can use my closet. I've made some space. Also, I've transferred you extra money to buy the dog's food, and for you to have proper meals. Don't spend it all at once. And, always check if the hotplates are switched off after cooking."

    "He insisted one last time to call him if there was anything before going, although he'd be busy helping the parents moving out from their old apartment in Paris." 
    "Another reason as for why Jeanne didn't want to go back home too early, she would have been sure to be exploited."
    "The company he started in his senior year of high school was faring so well that he had enough cash flow to buy a modest house near Calais for their parents to fully enjoy their retirement." 
    "The azure seaside was more preferable than this polluted and crowded grey town."
    "His excitement was showing, he had completed one of his numerous life-long goals."
    "When the door rang, Jeanne rolled off the sofa and welcomed Elise as her eyes ran through the flat."

    e "I didn't expect it to be so tidy and modern."
    j "My brother likes clean and lean. I guess it does change from your place."

    "Arthur had absolutely wanted a classic American-designed kitchen with a wooden counter connected to the living-room and at least two bedrooms."
    "According to him, it was trendy and practical. After buying it at the cost of his soul, he renovated the bathroom to make an Italian shower and isolated the walls for thermic efficiency and sound, the sound isolation being for his snoring to not bother his guest if he had one."

    e "Where can I leave my suitcase?"
    j "In my brother's room since you'll sleep there. He changed the sheets and all. My brother's kind of a clean freak. So don't do anything naughty in his bed."

    "Elise clicked her tongue."

    e "Like I would."

    "All of a sudden, Beyoncé's infamous song, Single Ladies, blasted their ears."

    j "Sorry. My new ringtone."

    "She took the call."

    j "Speaking of the devil."
    e "Arthur?"

    "Her big brother wanted to make sure that Elise arrived. She passed her the phone, since she was eyeing her phone so badly. He could have called her directly."

    "They put their wet socks away before flopping down on the couch. Normally, the weather should improve from tonight, but for now, they were exhausted from shopping and walking under the rain."
    "She got the crumbled paper in her pocket out as Elise put the purchases in the fridge."

    j "I'll think about it. Take you in. Like a stray dog. I'll take you in, you silly."
    e "Well, I don't know if Jeanne is suitable for a dog's name."
    j "Right, if I were a dog, I'd rather have an original name. Like 'Zeus'."
    e "How about 'Jesus'?"

    "Elise scoffed."

    e "Do you see yourself walking a dog named 'Jesus'? Jesus, sit. Jesus, give your paw. Jesus! Don't pee on this wall! Jesus, your thing's hanging."

    "Elise bit her lips to contain her laughter while Jeanne burst out laughing."

    e "I'm not going to hell for your stupid jokes. Let's cook dinner instead.."

    "And like the students they were, they whipped up two plates of carbonara pasta and returned to the sofa."

    j "Is there something you want to watch?" 

    "Jeanne said as she connected her laptop to the TV."

    e "How about studying?"
    j "Studying."

    "Jeanne slapped her hand against her forehead."

    j "Dumbass, we're on vacation."

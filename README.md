# A visual novel
A visual novel for a school project based on the first part of a novel I wrote, using Renpy, a Python-created visual novel engine.
In the usual Renpy architecture, you'll find a script.rpy that you can replace with the scripts I wrote and shared in this repository. The images are not included.
